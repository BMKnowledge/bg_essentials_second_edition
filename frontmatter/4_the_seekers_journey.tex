There are some who think that life is totally random or must be explainable by science to be valid. There are others who sense there is something more, something with divine meaning and purpose. Ultimately, however, everyone just wants to be loved and to experience lasting happiness.

To do this, most of us try to maximize pleasures and minimize discomforts through the material world. Many seek fulfillment in relationships or careers. Others turn to sex, drugs, food, shopping, or thrill-seeking to feel alive. The problem is, these desires naturally fuel a drive to accumulate more and more, attempting to fill the void felt inside.

Unfortunately, even the hard-earned happiness gained from these endeavors fades with time. Despite one’s best efforts, the results often leave people feeling empty, disillusioned, and even depressed. Others simply find themselves questioning if this is really all there is to life.

Realizing that the empty promises of the material world cannot satisfy all their needs, many embark on a spiritual journey in search of the only source of real, unconditional love: a relationship with God.
