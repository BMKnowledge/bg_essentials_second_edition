This second edition of the \textit{Bhagavad Gītā Essentials} presents a thoroughly revised text. As such, the Sanskrit transliterations have been carefully standardized according to IAST conventions. 

While the translations of the previous version were based on the \textit{Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā} with \textit{Gītā-bhāṣya} of Bhagavad Rāmānujācārya, 2013, by U. Ve. Sri Rama Rāmānuja Achari, the verse translation found in this edition has mostly been retranslated from scratch, with the goal of offering up a translation that is more in line with Tādātmya Vedānta, the philosophy of the Hari Bhakta Sampradāya. 

These revisions seek to provide readers and students with a more literal yet approachable and philosophically sound 
text suitable for study and reflection.
