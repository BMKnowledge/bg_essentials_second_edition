<h1>Preface to the Second Edition</h1>
<p>This second edition of the <em>Bhagavad Gītā Essentials</em> presents a thoroughly revised text. As such, the Sanskrit transliterations have been carefully standardized according to IAST conventions.</p>
<p>While the translations of the previous version were based on the <em>Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā</em> with <em>Gītā-bhāṣya</em> of Bhagavad Rāmānujācārya, 2013, by U. Ve. Sri Rama Rāmānuja Achari, the verse translation found in this edition has mostly been retranslated from scratch, with the goal of offering up a translation that is more in line with Tādātmya Vedānta, the philosophy of the Hari Bhakta Sampradāya.</p>
<p>These revisions seek to provide readers and students with a more literal yet approachable and philosophically sound text suitable for study and reflection.</p>
