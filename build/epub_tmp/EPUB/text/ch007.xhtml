<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> provides instruction and offers real, practical teachings on <em>yoga</em>, self-mastery and attaining perfection. We need such help because our incessant thoughts and desires inevitably lead to suffering. But by controlling and surrendering the mind to the Divine, we can become free from material conditioning. We return to our true Self and from there experience an eternal loving relationship with God. Through such teachings, the <em>Gītā</em> provides the ultimate solution to life’s challenges, and offers a treasure map to the most priceless gem of all: the knowledge of how to attain real love and lasting happiness.</p>
<p>Although it is more than a philosophy, it can be helpful to have an overview of some of the philosophical principles this scripture embodies</p>
<section id="sec-philosophical-foundations-of-the-bhagavad-gita" class="level2">
<h2>Philosophical Foundations of the<br />
Bhagavad Gītā</h2>
<p><em>Sanātana-dharma</em> (Hinduism) is founded on the idea that there is one Truth, one reality, one Supreme God, that is revealed in a number of ways. This explains the vast diversity and plurality that exists within this way of life. Various <em>gurus</em> and saints have come to humanity to reveal different traditions and pathways upon which the seeking individual can attain a first-hand experience of God. This has led to an immensely rich and profound spiritual culture which has lasted thousands of years.</p>
<p>But among all these elements, it is the <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> which has emerged as the flagship scripture. In just 701 verses, it manages to explain all the key spiritual truths. The divine nature of the Self, reincarnation, <em>karma</em>, the nature of God, and so much more, are all neatly woven together in one discourse. Despite the wide range of thought within <em>Sanātana-dharma</em>, the <em>Gītā</em> has remained a unique source of authority in philosophical matters. This can be seen by the huge number of commentaries given by <em>gurus</em>, teachers, and scholars.</p>
<p>Although given 5,000 years ago, the teachings of the <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> describe eternal truths which are entirely relevant to this day and age. Each verse is saturated with meaning and should be seen not as mere philosophical statements, but as meditations designed to dispel ignorance. By regularly engaging with the teachings, one can develop the wisdom to move forward in life and progress on the spiritual path.</p>

<h2>God in the Gītā</h2>
<p>Each tradition within <em>Sanātana-dharma</em> views God in a different way, and among them, Vaiṣṇavism is one such tradition that holds Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa) as the Supreme Lord. He is the original Person, the source of creation, the ground of all that exists. Kṛṣṇa is an <em>avatāra</em>, a complete incarnation of the Supreme Lord, who has entered this material world to uplift humanity. The <em>Gītā</em> therefore, is fundamentally a Vaiṣṇava scripture. Throughout it, we are repeatedly reminded of how everything depends on Kṛṣṇa, of how He is intrinsically present in the world, and at the same time, how He is beyond all of it.</p>
<p>In Kṛṣṇa, the <em>Gītā</em> shows that God is a deity who has a form, and who lovingly responds to His devotees. But at the same time, He does not simply reside in some distant Heaven. His presence pervades this material existence and He dwells within each living person. This entire world and the individual souls are an eternal part of His being. All of this becomes clear in the eleventh chapter where Arjuna is able to behold the cosmic form of Kṛṣṇa.</p>
<p>In the realm of material existence, only Kṛṣṇa and His Abode are exempt from the endless cycle of birth and death, creation and destruction. Kṛṣṇa is the highest reality since everything is supported, owned and controlled by Him, and everything that exists is only a part of His cosmic body.</p>

<h2>The War to Restore Righteousness</h2>
<p>The <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> is part of a much larger scripture known as the Mahābhārata which details the history of the kings in the ancient Kuru dynasty.</p>
<p>It all takes place about 5000 years ago in India. Pāṇḍu ruled the kingdom of Hastināpura, but due to a curse, he retired to the forest with his wives, leaving his blind brother, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, to take the throne. Eventually children were born. The five sons of Pāṇḍu (Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīma, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva) were known as the Pāṇḍavas, while the hundred sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra were called the Kauravas.</p>
<p>The righteous Pāṇḍavas were continuously persecuted by the jealous Duryodhana, the eldest of their Kaurava cousins. Eventually this ongoing feud led to the kingdom being divided between the two families. Unable to tolerate the growing success of the Pāṇḍavas, Duryodhana arranges a deceitful gambling match, the result of which forces the five brothers and their wife, Draupadī, into exile.</p>
<p>After thirteen long years, the Pāṇḍavas return to claim their kingdom, but despite repeated efforts for a peaceful resolution, Duryodhana refuses to compromise. In order to restore righteousness and vanquish the tyranny of the Kauravas, the Pāṇḍavas are left with no other choice but to wage war.</p>
<p>At this point, both sides gathered up their allies in preparation. Despite their affection for the Pāṇḍavas, many elders and relatives, such as their grandfather Bhīṣma and their teacher Droṇa, join the Kaurava army. All are profoundly aware of Duryodhana’s arrogance and unrighteous behaviour, but filled with a sense of duty to the kingdom, they are ready to fight for him. Consequently, one family stands divided on the Kurukṣetra battlefield.</p>
<p>Arjuna and Duryodhana both approach Kṛṣṇa for help in the coming battle. Much to their surprise, Kṛṣṇa has taken an oath that He will not fight for any side. Instead, He presents two choices to both of them. In one hand, He offers his immensely powerful and illustrious army; in the other, He offers Himself, alone and unarmed. Arjuna is given first choice and, without doubt, chooses Kṛṣṇa. Duryodhana is both shocked and relieved. Without hesitation, he gleefully accepts the army that he thinks will assure him of victory.</p>
<p>Duryodhana assumes Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary mortal, fallible and limited. He views Him as a means to fulfilling his desires. Arjuna, on the other hand, sees Kṛṣṇa as his dear friend and indeed as his world. He does not care for the army, the kingdom or for any victory, he simply wants Kṛṣṇa. It is this bond of Love that causes the Lord to serve Arjuna. As a result, the original Creator of the universe, the all-pervasive, omnipotent personality that is Kṛṣṇa, takes on the role of a humble charioteer.</p>

<h2>The Lord takes the Lead</h2>
<p>Arjuna’s confusion and distress at the beginning of the battle provides the space for Kṛṣṇa to transcend His position as a charioteer, cousin and friend. He then assumes the role of the spiritual guru and takes responsibility for Arjuna’s spiritual evolution. While we, as the reader of this timeless dialogue, take the place of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Kṛṣṇa is none other than the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa. Of His own Will, He enters into His creation to restore righteousness and awaken the hearts of His devotees. Within this one form of God, there is the potential for every kind of relationship with God. For example, as a child, Kṛṣṇa grew up in the forest of Vṛndāvana tending the cows. Wherever He went, His all-attractive persona captured the minds of the people. His mother Yaśodā attained the highest form of Love through maternal affection. His cowherd companions evolved through friendship with Him. The simple <em>gopīs</em> (cowherd girls) saw Him as their Lover and reached ecstatic states of devotion.</p>
<p>But the secret of His divine nature is not revealed to everyone. Through His divine <em>yoga-māyā</em>, the power of illusion, He conceals His true identity. Only those who have been graced to see Him can know Him as He truly is. Through Kṛṣṇa’s grace, Arjuna is given these “eyes to see” in Chapter 11.</p>
<p>The <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> is built upon this profound relationship, demonstrating how devotion and a spirit of surrender allows one to see the Truth.</p>

<h2>Your Part of the Story</h2>
<p>The dialogue between Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa is an ancient hymn that has been sung for thousands of years. The poetic 701 Sanskrit verses detail a story of profound personal transformation. But it is not only the story of Arjuna the warrior. It is also the story of everyone on the path to God.</p>
<p>The Kurukṣetra War lasted 18 days; each of the 18 chapters of the <em>Gītā</em> reflects one of those days. Together, the story told in verse and the commentary given by the <em>guru</em>, shed a brilliant light of Love on the 18-step journey that every sincere spiritual seeker takes on the quest to attain the Lord.</p>
<p>A word to the wise: don’t just read the story. Use this conversation between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna as a guide on your own spiritual journey. Climb into the chariot and take a seat next to Arjuna at the feet of the <em>guru</em>. Become His disciple as well. Absorb your whole being in these wisdom teachings and you’ll discover the mysteries of life, eternal truths of creation, and the true purpose of human existence.</p>
<p>By understanding and applying the wisdom given by Kṛṣṇa, and by meditating on the insightful commentary of Paramahamsa Vishwananda, you can stand beside Arjuna, and together, fight in the most important battle of all time.</p>
<p>The <em>Bhagavad Gītā</em> is a call to awaken the soul. It is a map for navigating the perilous journey from the head to the heart where we will find the most valuable treasure of all: the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The scene is now set for one of the greatest encounters the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Let the adventure begin…</p>
