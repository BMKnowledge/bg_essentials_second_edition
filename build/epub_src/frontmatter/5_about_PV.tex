In our modern times, human beings often live lives of profound ignorance---mistaking the body and mind for the self, oblivious to their own divine essence, and losing awareness of their eternal relationship with God. But the \textit{Bhagavad Gītā} compassionately reveals the way out of this delusion. In verse 4.34, Lord Kṛṣṇa instructs:

\begin{customquote}\fontsize{10}{11}\selectfont
\textit{Learn such wisdom by submission, extensive inquiry, and service from a spiritual master. Such realized beings will impart it to you, for they directly perceive the Truth.}
\end{customquote}

It is the duty of these realized beings, who have directly seen the Truth (\textit{tattva-darśīs}), to guide others from ignorance to awakening. Paramahamsa Vishwananda is such a being---a \textit{satguru}, a spiritual master whose life and teachings embody and exemplify this divine Truth.

Rooted in traditional \textit{bhakti-yoga}, the path of loving devotion, Paramahamsa Vishwananda’s mission is to open the hearts of mankind to the love of God in our modern times.  He reminds us that spirituality is not just a complimentary part of our lives; rather it is their very foundation---to be lived and expressed in every moment. All genuine spiritual practices, rituals, and knowledge lead us beyond the confines of ego and mind, awakening a living, breathing relationship with an infinite, blissful, and loving God.

As a Vaiṣṇava \textit{ācārya} and true \textit{satguru}, Paramahamsa Vishwananda has established the Hari Bhakta Sampradāya---a lineage and home for all devotees (\textit{bhaktas}) of Śrī Hari, the Supreme Lord. This living tradition unmistakably carries His grace and guidance, revealing the glory of the Lord in a unique and personal way. His profound compassion, humor, and humility bring the highest truths down to earth, so that a path traditionally pursued by the few can truly feel accessible to all.

For those who wish to connect with Him, Paramahamsa Vishwananda shares His wisdom through His books, teachings, spiritual practices, live \textit{satsaṅgas} (discourses), Darshan blessings, pilgrimages and His worldwide organization, Bhakti Marga---\enquote{the path of devotion}
