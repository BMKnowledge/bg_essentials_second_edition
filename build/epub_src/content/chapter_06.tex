\chaptersubtitle{The Process of Meditation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Now that renunciation and the nature of action have been thoroughly explained, chapter six begins to describe \textit{dhyāna-yoga} or meditation. Kṛṣṇa up till now has provided a step-by-step path beginning with \textit{karma-yoga}. Once this is successfully practiced, one achieves inner tranquility. This creates the desired state for \textit{dhyāna-yoga}, where the mind is made to focus within and have the direct perception of the \textit{ātmā}.

Kṛṣṇa gives Arjuna the practical techniques upon which one can best attempt to master the mind through the practice of meditation. Gradually, through intense self-control and repeated practice, one is able to perceive the \textit{ātmā} and experience limitless joy, free from suffering. Responding to Arjuna’s fears of failure, Kṛṣṇa explains that the fruits of this \textit{yoga} are never lost. If one does not achieve the goal in this life, one will inevitably be given the right circumstances to carry on one’s spiritual development.

The chapter concludes by stating that the one who is absorbed in the path of \textit{yoga}, given by Kṛṣṇa thus far, is superior to all other spiritual seekers, but among all such \textit{yogīs}, the one who dwells on Kṛṣṇa is the highest of all. It is this last verse which marks the beginning of a new line of discourse in the \textit{Gītā}: one where Kṛṣṇa places Himself explicitly as the Supreme Lord and teaches Arjuna the way of \textit{bhakti} (devotion).

\enquote{Very often you will see people calling themselves renunciates, but still they enjoy everything, they are bothered about everything. They are renunciates only on the outside, but inside they have a certain motive or a certain aim behind their actions.}

\enquote{On the other hand, people who live in the world, but are not attached to it, who dedicate their life to serving others, to helping people, helping the animals, protecting the animals, they are the true \textit{sannyāsīs}.}

\enquote{Those who are doing every action without expecting something in return, selflessly; those who love unconditionally; those who are devoid of pride and ego and expectation; those who have renounced the mind (because it is the mind that desires and always longs for recognition); they are the true \textit{sannyāsīs}. It's not the color or the clothes that they are wearing; that’s not \textit{sannyāsa}. It’s not the external \textit{sannyāsa}. It is the internal.}

\enquote{The mind is the best friend of one who has conquered the mind. Who has conquered what? It is the Self that conquers the mind.}

\enquote{So, what happens? The thoughts and subsequent actions, which are always under the command of the mind, change. Now, the mind is being controlled by the soul. When the mind is running somewhere else, the soul says, \enquote{Come back here!,} and puts you on the right track.}

\enquote{If you don’t control the mind, if you don’t succeed in your endeavor, the mind will become your worst enemy. This is when, very often, people go into deep depression. They collapse. They can’t handle anything. Even if they have all knowledge, but yet they\ldots have let the mind poison them.}

\enquote{When the mind and the senses are controlled, they don’t run after the sense objects, so one can direct the senses to where one wants; this is \enquote{self-mastery.} If the mind and senses are under control, they can be focused on God, on the image of the Divine, which will lead one towards God-realization.}

\enquote{The ones who are completely surrendered to God,\ldots through the control of the mind, they don’t get disturbed by anything. They are not touched by pleasure or pain, honor and dishonor, or anything. These opposites don’t affect them at all, because they see the Divine in everything. This is the quality of someone who has merged into his own Self. He reflects calmness, peace, tranquility and joy. These qualities emanate from the ones who are not agitated by anything; they are free.}

\enquote{True \textit{yogīs} are here on Earth to love: they always stay in that loving state and in that loving state, there is no judgment. It’s not like human love, where you put someone high up on a pedestal, and then the moment you hear or see something that you don’t like about the person you think you love, then you become aggressive, and depressive---you become all the \enquote{sives}---expansive, expressive, oppressive, and possessive\ldots Whereas the ones who excel are above all this, as they look at everything equally and rejoice in God consciousness. They see that it is God who is doing this multitude of activities through His creation. It is God who has manifested Himself and is enjoying Himself while He is doing everything.}

\enquote{There is no need to judge when you are absorbed in Divine Love. The only thing to do is to love. That’s why I chose \enquote{Just Love} Otherwise I would tell you, \enquote{Think about Love, think Love.} No, I said, \enquote{Just Love,} don’t bother about anything. Don’t worry. Your aim is to love. This is your \textit{dharma}.}

\enquote{Kṛṣṇa is saying you should practice your \textit{sādhana} for self-purification. Without self-purification, you can’t advance. This purification is very important. He is emphasizing purification through meditation. Purify yourself by chanting the Name of God, meditate on the Lord, meditate on His glory, meditate on His form, meditate on His Name.}

\enquote{For a \textit{yogī} to sit in Times Square is easy, because that one has transcended everything. But people who have not yet transcended, still have to find this quiet place in the outside where they will not be disturbed, where the mind will not run left and right.}

\enquote{The time and the place of meditation are very important, because when you set a certain time to meditate, you are inviting God to be there with you. It’s like if you invite a friend to come to your place and then you are not there to welcome your friend. How would it be? Or you are invited somewhere, you are ringing the bell and you see all the lights off. Then someone turns the light on and you see the person in pyjamas saying, \enquote{Ai! I thought it was tomorrow!} How would it be? You would be shocked, no? So, here it is the same thing. When you set a certain time to sit for meditation, you are inviting God to manifest Himself at that moment. And you can have this expectation that, as you sent the invitation, God will come and be eagerly waiting for you inside yourself at that time.}

\enquote{Here Kṛṣṇa makes an analogy between a still mind and an unmoving flame: the mind is \enquote{motionless like the light of a lamp in a windless place.} A flame is always moving, but when it is sheltered, blocked from all sides, it doesn’t move, it doesn’t flicker; it is stable, it shines, it radiates light! Like that, when one is fully absorbed in the divine Self, God within oneself, nothing can deviate one from the path and automatically one starts to shine all the divine qualities.}

\enquote{When through deep meditation, one has perceived the true reality, \enquote{which is perceived by the intelligence and is beyond the senses}; when one has perceived and attained this bliss through meditation on God; when God has revealed this supreme aspect of Himself within oneself, \enquote{established therein, the soul can no longer fall away from the spiritual truth of its being.} In this state, one perceives this oneness and the everlasting, imperishable joy and bliss emanating from God within oneself. One is God-realized, one is a true \textit{yogī} and one is never disunited from God. Whatever one does in life, whether it is having children, eating, drinking, or sleeping, if one is centered in that state, nothing can touch that person. One stays ever free. That’s why you see that in ancient times, the sages were all \textit{karma-yogīs}, they were all married, even the \textit{gurus}, and their wives were supporting their work. All those greater mothers also attained the same state of God-realization as their husbands, due to their surrender, their service, their \textit{bhakti}, and the dedication that they had to their husbands.}

\enquote{Lord Kṛṣṇa says that the ones who have attained this supreme state, whatever they do in the outside world, they are completely free, even if it may appear that they are limited. One might ask, \enquote{If you are a \textit{yogī}, why do you need to sleep? If you are a \textit{yogī}, why do you need to eat?} But as they are established in the Self, they are beyond duality, they are beyond the judgment of right and wrong, they are beyond the judgment of being husband and wife, they are beyond the duality of man and woman, they are beyond heat and cold, they are beyond \enquote{good} and \enquote{bad} and other opposites.}

\enquote{Everything that you do, once you have attained bliss, is infused with that bliss\ldots When bliss awakens inside of you, it starts to consume you and it is forever. It will keep growing. There is not an end to that bliss\ldots All the saints of the Lord are absorbed in that bliss.}

\enquote{Arjuna’s question was how to gain control of this unsteady mind. Bhagavān has replied to him saying that it is possible to do so through constant practice of mental discipline and observance, to observe the mind, to observe how the mind is thinking, to keep the mind on the path of reflection\ldots that will free oneself from attachment. But He is saying that one must practice. Wherever you focus your mind, that mind takes a shape. It’s like liquid. It doesn’t have a form itself, but it takes the form of a receptacle. You pour water in a bottle, it takes the form of a bottle.}

\enquote{Such is this mind also. If you feed that mind with negativity, it will become negative. \enquote{If you are sitting here, O Arjuna, and telling Me, ‘No, no, I can’t do it, I can’t do it, I can’t do it,’ you will not be able to.} If you sit and say, \enquote{I can’t, I can’t, I can’t,} you are building a brick wall where you are closing yourself inside. You are blinding yourself, you are finding thousands of excuses for not doing your \textit{sādhana}, for not practicing your \textit{kriyā}. Here Bhagavān says, \enquote{Practice is very important. Don’t find excuses.} Stop saying, \enquote{I can’t, I can’t, I can’t}; sing, \enquote{I can, I can, I can} and, \enquote{I will, I will, I will.} And when you sit down in your meditation, have this pure conviction that the Almighty Lord Himself is with you.}

\enquote{Kṛṣṇa says that when your mind is jumping from one thing to the other, don’t run into your weakness, don’t run into your fear! Don’t think that your desire for God is too much or too far away. One should always be alert and not allow the mind to think about anything but God. He has given so many divine forms, He has given so many Divine Names to enable mankind to completely focus on Him. When you sit for meditation, if you perceive your mind going somewhere else, let it go, but then bring it back. Show your power over it through the intellect. Show that the Great Observer is more powerful than the mind. That’s why you can bring back your thought and control it. Remind yourself continuously, even if you don’t notice when the mind ran away and slipped out. When it slips out, don’t dwell on the object that has attracted the mind: instead bring the mind back and fix it \enquote{in the Self.} Fix it on God! God dwells in the identity of the soul as the Supersoul.}

\enquote{If you don’t reach it in one life, it doesn’t get wasted, because spirituality is not tangible. Spirituality is not something which is made up of matter, but it is made up of faith inside of you. What is happening right now is a continuation from what you have started before. And if in this life you don’t attain it, it will still carry on in the next life.}

\enquote{Those who have faith in God, they are not lost. This is His assurance.}

\enquote{The surroundings create an effect on people. Even if one has grace, it can stay dormant inside one’s heart. Deep inside one has the feeling, \enquote{I am incomplete.} However, due to the environment, due to the surroundings, due to the mind’s activities, they only get drawn to the outside reality. They get tempted and controlled by the outside reality, and then they don’t have the grace to find their path in this lifetime. However, through the grace that they received, through the \textit{puṇya} that they accumulated, they are born again on this Earth in spiritual families which will contribute to their spiritual growth\ldots This means that the ones who try their best, never lose. They enjoy celestial regions for long years and are born again on Earth to continue on their spiritual advancement.}

\enquote{In this life, through \textit{sādhana}, through following the words of the master, the one who has faith in one’s practice, who has faith in God, transcends the enjoyment of this world, as well as the next one. And due to the fruits of past good \textit{puṇya}, one continues practicing and advancing on the path to Enlightenment.}

Then, they will be called back again. And if they die, they will be called again in their next life.}

\enquote{The soul sees the path that will lead one to the spiritual family---\textit{vasudhaiva-kuṭumbakaṁ}---this unification of one family\ldots A real family is one that shares with you, who stands with you, however you are, who supports you on your way. That’s real family.}
