\chaptersubtitle{The Three Modes of Nature}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent In the opening verses, Kṛṣṇa states that He is the one who gives life to the unconscious \textit{prakṛti} (material world) which then gives birth to all things. Out of this \textit{prakṛti} comes the different \textit{guṇas} (qualities) known as \textit{sattva}, \textit{rajas} and \textit{tamas}. These \textit{guṇas} bind the Self to this material body.

\textit{Sattva} is goodness which brings wisdom, purity, detachment, and kindness. \textit{Rajas} is passion that encourages activity, restlessness, and attachment. \textit{Tamas} is ignorance that brings negligence, lethargy, and sleep. At various times and situations, one \textit{guṇa} will predominate over the others, influencing our state and experience of life.

Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that those who exist in \textit{sattva} at death will be in true knowledge and attain higher realms. Those in \textit{rajas} will come back to a life of action in this world, and those who dwell in \textit{tamas} will be dragged down to be born among the deluded. But real eternal freedom is gained by one who rises beyond all three of the \textit{guṇas}. Such a person is not swayed by this material world and is unaffected by pain, pleasure, joy, and sorrow. In conclusion, Kṛṣṇa reminds Arjuna that it is through \textit{bhakti} that one can cross over the bondage of the \textit{guṇas} to realize the supreme state.

\enquote{Bhagavān says that all creation is His womb, and is where He places the seed. He places each spirit according to their qualities, their \textit{dharma}, and certain things that they have to do; like seeds that sprout into various forms.}

\enquote{He also says that your spirit is free, it is never touched by these qualities. But \textit{karma}---the qualities---that roams around the spirit determines the form of creation. If they are good qualities, one is born as a human being, with good nature and manners; you are brought on your spiritual path, finding your spiritual way.}

\enquote{When the \textit{ātmā} starts to manifest into this world, it utilizes matter---\textit{prakṛti}---to manifest. From the subtle state it manifests into the gross state, which implies all forms, including not only all the species in this world, but also of the different spheres in the celestial worlds. He is also referring to the \textit{devas}, like Indra, and to the Rākṣasas, the demons, the lower beings, spirits, and ghosts, which symbolize the \textit{tamasic} lower qualities.}

\enquote{It’s through \textit{prakṛti} that His will is manifested, but He’s ever-free from it. Everything and everybody is under His influence and supervision. Wherever He has placed each one and however He is guiding each one, is perfect. And one has to learn to accept this.}

\enquote{Bhagavān is describing here the qualities of the three \textit{guṇas}: how they manifest and what qualities one perceives. This is not about judging others. It’s not about seeing these qualities in other people. Be careful! These qualities are not in other people; they are in you, in each individual. You have this human body due to these three \textit{guṇas}. Bhagavān has previously said that this world is created due to these three \textit{guṇas}. And these three \textit{guṇas} include also your physical body and the mind. It’s not about pointing a finger at others. It’s about looking at yourself---which \textit{guṇa} predominates inside of you. This is also not about judging yourself. Of course, if you are fully \textit{tamasic} you will start judging. But be aware what you have to change and what you have to transcend to purify yourself.}

\textbf{Qualities of\textit{ sattva-guṇa}:}\enquote{The \textit{sattvic guṇa} is a touch of the divine positive nature. This \textit{guṇa} guides one in doing all good actions\ldots one is not attached to power, name, fame, glamour, or wealth. Everything becomes balanced. The mind, the mental state, is always at peace, even if everything else is busy, one’s mind is calm and serene.}

\enquote{Someone who has \textit{sattvic} qualities focuses their enjoyment on the Lord. Whatever one does is to achieve God-realization. Everything they do is with purity. Everything is bound by a great knowledge of the Lord, a great knowledge of the Self, and someone who has these \textit{sattvic} qualities is happy; they are in bliss. They are not worried about how and what. They are not worried about what they have. They know that the Lord will take care of them and they long for their spiritual advancement.}

\textbf{Qualities of \textit{rajo-guṇa}:} \enquote{For one who has \textit{rajasic} qualities, the mind always dwells on external enjoyment or desires, greed, envy, lust and many activities where the mind is in a permanent state of restlessness, constantly moving left, right, left, right, left, right; so, one becomes miserable. Due to this state of mind, one is dragged into the cycle, the whirlpool, of birth and death. Constantly coming out and in, in and out, one remains a slave. One would say, \enquote{When will I be free?} But to be free one has to transcend these qualities.}

\enquote{Bhagavān says here that one with \textit{rajasic} qualities does not learn to attain the grace of God, to attain the Lord through devotion and Love. How many people really understand Love? Not many. How many people really live this Love? Not many. People whose minds always dwell on outside things don’t know about this Love; they have a certain image of love. They create a certain reality and they call it love, when in reality it’s not love at all. It is attachment and this type of love falls into this category. Whereas true Love frees oneself, and true Love is the core of what one has to attain.}

\textbf{Qualities of \textit{tamo-guṇa}:} \enquote{Bhagavān says the roots of \textit{tamasic} qualities arise due to ignorance. You can see this in the world nowadays, when people are not aware that they have a life. They walk like zombies in the street, not present. They are completely deluded by these qualities.}

\enquote{The different activities that reflect these qualities include sleeping, lazing around and so on, always playing computer games non-stop. Even when they go away from the computer, the mind is drawn back to the computer game.}

\enquote{With these \textit{tamasic} qualities, this attachment to these lower frequencies, to lower manifestations, one becomes a slave to them. They can’t be free. And such is the deluded mind: the mind is so active that it doesn’t want them to realize themselves, and so the soul goes dormant. The mind that is focused on \textit{tamasic} qualities and has these tendencies is blind; one with such a mind doesn’t want to hear about God at all! They don’t want to hear about anything that is positive, just like the Rākṣasas, demons, and \textit{asuras}. Their minds are constantly drawn to harming and to hurting. This \textit{tamasic} mind doesn’t know anything else. Such people are kept in the cycle of birth and death. They can’t be free from this cycle.}

\enquote{When the mind, senses and the vital air are diverted from the normal activities or functions like hearing, seeing, eating, drinking, reflecting, sleeping, sitting and so on---when one attains true knowledge, which one gets on the spiritual path---and one is absorbed through meditation on the Self\ldots the mind runs inwardly.}

\enquote{One doesn’t go on an outside journey, but an inner journey. When one follows this inner journey, automatically one rises---due to the \textit{sattvic} \textit{bhāva}---and the state of mind at that moment changes. The state of mind is not to focus on the outside reality. Due to these \textit{sattvic} qualities inside of you, one makes one’s journey inside. When one follows the inside journey, one perceives that there’s another reality---the Great Observer---and one perceives that it is the Self that observes the reality of life, and that all this drama of the \textit{sattvic}, \textit{rajasic}, and \textit{tamasic} qualities is just outside. These qualities are not related to the \textit{ātmā}. They are related only to the body. At this moment, true consciousness awakens. In this state, one rises above the \textit{guṇas} and one perceives God within oneself, the Supersoul, the Lord of all.}

\enquote{One who recognizes God within oneself is not connected to the three \textit{guṇas}. One who perceives God in everything is not bound by the three \textit{guṇas} and automatically, one who is absorbed in such a state of divine consciousness, doesn’t identify with the outside reality. One perceives that beyond these \textit{guṇas} is only Bhagavān Himself who is the absolute form and that it is Him only in His formless aspect (\textit{nirguṇa} state), that manifests everything.}

  </div>
</div>
\end{html}



\enquote{Bhagavān is revealing the qualities of those who are above the \textit{guṇas}. They are not touched by blame or by honor. A mind which is completely under control exhibits the highest degree of calmness, serenity, tranquility. That mind is not touched by any turmoil. It remains equal under all circumstances.}

\enquote{One who has become completely absorbed in the cosmic body of the Lord, whose mind has transformed and become light, is above the game of the three \textit{guṇas}. They observe only\ldots They are not bound by judgment. Their eyes still see, but there’s no judgment of what they see. Their nose still smells, but there’s no good or bad. Even if they do something that for the mind of men appears crazy, they are not bound by prejudice. They stay always free. Honor and dishonor is the same to them.}

\enquote{As long as you entertain these three \textit{guṇas}, you are in the grip of \textit{māyā} and you are dancing to Her tune. As I always say, \textit{māyā} puts on the music, and you dance like a puppet. Like a tamed animal in a circus, kept in a cage. When the circus man throws his whip, the animal starts dancing, like the tamed monkey that turns and jumps around. This is similar to what Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa is saying: the circus of life. As long as one doesn’t break through and rise above this, one remains in this circus. And as long as you stay in the game of this circus, there is judgment. But with the disappearance of all these \textit{guṇas}, when you are above, looking from the \textit{ātmā’s} point of view, when you sit in meditation, you perceive there is no judgment!}

\enquote{Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa Himself is saying, \enquote{Be in this state! Don’t be in a state of judgment. And don’t entertain the game of the \textit{guṇas}, which means, don’t say, ‘I am \textit{rajasic} or \textit{sattvic} or \textit{tamasic}.’” Also don’t look for this in others, because it’s easy to see. Now that you have heard about these three \textit{guṇas} you could start saying, \enquote{Ah, that person was \textit{rajasic}, that person was \textit{tamasic}. And that person was \textit{sattvic}.} Three \textit{guṇas} fever! Move away from this fever, and you’ll be healthy!}

\enquote{When you are fully absorbed in the Divine within you, you become a \textit{guṇātītaḥ}, you go above the three \textit{guṇas}. In such a state you are in complete bliss. That’s why bliss can’t be explained. You can’t say bliss is happiness or bliss is sadness. You can’t say that this person who is jumping around and happy is in a very blissful state. No! Because bliss is a state when you are fully absorbed in your Self.}

Here I am in front of you as Vāsudeva Kṛṣṇa.} All these forms and aspects of the Divine have been manifested throughout time to remind people of their real \textit{dharma}; of why they have come here; why they are here; of how to free themselves; of how to attain their cosmic body and how to rise above this duality; how to rise above the game of \textit{māyā} and how to rise above these three \textit{guṇas}. And only through this will one attain supreme bliss, will one attain this blissful state, will one become blissful. Kṛṣṇa Himself says here, \enquote{It’s easy to attain this state. Just surrender to Me! If you love Me, if you serve Me, if you hear My glory, I shall reveal this supreme bliss to you. Not outside, but within yourself and from within yourself you will beam this out to all.} This is God-realization. This is surrender and this is true happiness.}
